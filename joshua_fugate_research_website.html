                The <i>Nintendo DSi</i> is the second generation of the Nintendo DS line of consoles. It was released in Japan on November 1, 2008 and worldwide in April 2009. The larger model named the <i>Nintendo DSi XL</i> released in Japan on November 21, 2009 and worldwide in March 2010. The original launch price of the <i>DSi</i> was $169.99 and $189.99 for the <i>DSi XL</i>. The core design of the <i>DSi</i> is similar to that of the DS Lite, however, the <i>DSi</i> features two digital cameras, supports internal and external storage, and connects to an online store that Nintendo coined the Nintendo DSi Shop. The new functionality was meant to lead the user to personalize their <i>DSi</i>. This was to encourage family members to buy indiviual <i>DSi</i> for each member of the family who wanted one instead of having one <i>DSi</i> per household. The <i>DSi</i> offers exclusive physical media along with DS games that include specific <i>DSi</i> features along with the ability to play original DS games. The only problem is that you cannot play earlier DS games on the <i>DSi</i> that require a GBA slot. The <i>DSi</i> and <i>DSi XL</i> have combined sold a total of 41 million units. Reviews for the <i>DSi</i> were overall positive, however there was some complaints due to the <i>DSi's</i> cameras low resolution and the inability to play games that require the GBA cartridge. The <i>DSi</i> was seen as the pinacle console in the DS family of consoles. It was followed up and succeeded by the new line of DS consoles called the Nintendo 3DS.

                The <i>Nintendo 3DS</i> is the successor to the Nintendo DS line of consoles. The <i>3DS</i> was announced in March 2010 and first shown at E3 2010. The <i>3DS</i> was first releaed in Japan on Febuary 26, 2011 and released worldwide on July 28, 2011. The <i>3DS</i> released at $249 to a disappointing launch. The significant price led the <i>3DS</i> to have drastically lower launch sales than expected. Due to this, Nintendo lowered the price to $169. An XL version of the <i>3DS</i> was also released for $199.99 similarly to the DSi and DSi XL. The primary feature new to the <i>3DS</i> was the stereoscopic 3D effects on the screen of the console without the use of 3D goggles. The <i>3DS</i> also featured the new StreetPass and SpotPass tag modes made using the Nintendo Network. Augmented reality was implimented using the <i>3DS'</i> 3D cameras. A virtual console was also added to the <i>3DS</i> which allows users to play games originally released on older Nintendo gaming consoles. The Nintendo eShop made its debute on the <i>3DS</i>. An application called the Miiverese was realeased on the <i>3DS</i> and acted as a social networking service. The <i>3DS</i> also had the ability to use applications like an internet browser, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Youtube. Nintendo Video, a messaging app called Swapnote and Mii Maker are other notable applications available on the <i>3DS</i>. The hardware of the <i>3DS</i> was a noticable improvement to the DSi boasting 2 GB of eMMC flash memory compared to the DSi's 256 MB of internal flash memory, a dual-core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM11_MPCore">ARM11 MPCORE</a> based CPU clocked at 268  MHz. The GPU of the <i>3DS</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PICA200">PICA200</a> clocked at 268 MHz. Lastly the <i>3DS</i> featured the Circle Pad, a round nub-like analog stick and six-axis motion sensor that includes a 3-axis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer"> accelerometer</a> and a 3-axis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope">gyroscope</a>.
