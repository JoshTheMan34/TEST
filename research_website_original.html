                The <i>Nintendo DSi</i> is the second generation of the Nintendo DS line of consoles. It was released in Japan on November 1, 2008 and worldwide in April 2009. The larger model named the <i>Nintendo DSi XL</i> released in Japan on November 21, 2009 and worldwide in March 2010. The original launch price of the <i>DSi</i> was $169.99 and $189.99 for the <i>DSi XL</i>. The core design of the <i>DSi</i> is similar to that of the DS Lite, however, the <i>DSi</i> features two digital cameras, supports internal and external storage, and connects to an online store that Nintendo coined the Nintendo DSi Shop. The new functionality was meant to lead the user to personalize their <i>DSi</i>. This was to encourage family members to buy indiviual <i>DSi</i> for each member of the family who wanted one instead of having one <i>DSi</i> per household. The <i>DSi</i> offers exclusive physical media along with DS games that include specific <i>DSi</i> features along with the ability to play original DS games. The only problem is that you cannot play earlier DS games on the <i>DSi</i> that require a GBA slot. The <i>DSi</i> and <i>DSi XL</i> have combined sold a total of 41 million units. Reviews for the <i>DSi</i> were overall positive, however there was some complaints due to the <i>DSi's</i> cameras low resolution and the inability to play games that require the GBA cartridge. The <i>DSi</i> was seen as the pinacle console in the DS family of consoles. It was followed up and succeeded by the new line of DS consoles called the Nintendo 3DS.

An application called the Miiverese was realeased on the <i>3DS</i> and acted as a social networking service. The <i>3DS</i> also had the ability to use applications like an internet browser, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Youtube. Nintendo Video, a messaging app called Swapnote and Mii Maker are other notable applications available on the <i>3DS</i>. The hardware of the <i>3DS</i> was a noticable improvement to the DSi boasting 2 GB of eMMC flash memory compared to the DSi's 256 MB of internal flash memory, a dual-core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM11_MPCore" style="color:rgb(15, 224, 109)">ARM11 MPCORE</a> based CPU clocked at 268  MHz.

                The last and newest generation of the Nintendo DS and 3DS family of consoles is the <i>"new" 3DS and "new" 3DS XL</i>. The <i>"new" 3DS</i> was released in Japan on October 11, 2014 and worldwide through 2014 and September 25, 2015. The original price for the <i>"new" 3DS</i> was $219.99 for the bundle and $199.99 for the <i>"new" 3DS XL</i>.The <i>"new" 3DS</i> improves on the original 3DS in an abundance of ways. The <i>"new" 3DS</i> has upgraded processors, an increased amount of RAM, a C-stick (analog pointing stick) and two additional shoulder triggers which are called ZR and ZL. The C-Stick allows the <i>"new" 3DS</i> to have backwards compatability with games that use features equivalent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS#Circle_Pad_Pro" style="color:rgb(223, 117, 18)">Circle Pad Pro</a> add-on. The <i>"new" 3DS</i> also has face detection to optimize the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereoscopy" style="color:rgb(223, 117, 18)">autostereoscopic 3D</a> display. The <i>"new" 3DS</i> also includes a 4 GB microSD card and NFC built into the system. New design changes such as colored buttons on the face of the console, curved edges, and a different placement of buttons differentiate the <i>"new" 3DS</i> and the original 3DS. The <i>"new" 3DS</i> also includes the ability to read and use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiibo" style="color:rgb(223, 117, 18)">Amiibo</a> thanks to the NFC. The <i>"new" 3DS</i> continued to use the same AC adapter as the original DSi, DSi XL, and the 3DS. The <i>"new" 3DS</i> was compatable with previous DSi, DSi XL, and origianal DS and DS Lite games released for each respective console. The <i>"new" 3DS</i> saw the return of the Nintendo eShop as well as StreetPass and SpotPass. The web browser got an update that allowed for support of HTML-5 based video playback. Nintendo discontinued production of the <i>"new" Nintendo 3DS</i> in July 2019 with the arrival of Nintendo's newest console, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/" style="color:rgb(223, 117, 18)">Nintendo Switch</a>. However, the <i>"new" 3DS</i> is still supported to this day.
